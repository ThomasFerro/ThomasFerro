    <main><h1>Building a blogging application part 2 - The domains</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Introducing the blogging application domains</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the previous post, I have introduced the back story of this project and his goals.</p>

<p>This second part will dive into the several domains involved.</p>

<p>This is not a definitive feature list, but more of a macro road map.</p>

<h2>MVP</h2>

<p>I really want this project to be available as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This way, I will be able to validate the technical environment and most importantly I will know if it feels good to use and develop.</p>

<p>In order to do that, I will restrain myself to a single domain with a bare minimum of features.</p>

<p>This domain will be the <strong>Reader</strong> one, with the following features :</p>

<ol>
<li>As a reader, I want to access the list of all available articles.</li>
<li>As a reader, I want to access the content of a specific article.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is kind of a <em>read only</em> mode, but it will already make for an effective experience.</p>

<h2>Regarding the social aspects</h2>

<p>There are two more domains that I can think of for the next iterations.</p>

<p>First, a <strong>Reviewer</strong> domain that will allow people to comment and rate the articles.</p>

<p>Then, a <strong>Reviser</strong> domain whose goal is to provide a way to notify the writer that there are typos or any other issues within the articles.</p>

<p>These two additional domains will help for a more social experience, where the writer can have fast and clear feedbacks from his audience.</p>

<p>Of course, the details of those domains are not fixed and I will be able to experience a lot since they will be self-contained.</p>

<p>I also think of features to add to the <strong>Reader</strong> domain, such as the search for terms in all articles, a way to save articles for later read, etc.</p>

<h2>Regarding the writer</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that I always speak about a single writer in this post.</p>

<p>Once again, this is an iterative process.</p>

<p>I plain to include a <strong>Writer</strong> domain, with several features and the possibility to have multiple writers within the same environment.</p>

<p>The application will then be able to provide a fully operational blogging environment tailored to the needs of all his users.</p>

<h2>In the next episode&hellip;</h2>

<p>Now that the goals and the domains are introduced, I would like to share my wishes about the development process.</p>

<p>In the next post, I will try to explain how I want this application to be developed, tested and deployed.</p>

    <main><h1>Building a blogging application part 1 - The goals</h1>

<h2>There was an idea..</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;  to bring together a group of remarkable technologies, see if they could become something more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Behind this not very subtle reference lies the whole idea of this series of posts.</p>

<h3>Genesis</h3>

<p>I think that a little of backstory is necessary to fully understand the shift of mind that leads to the making of this post.</p>

<p>We are, with a friend of mine, working at an IT services company and are currently in a mission within a little team of software engineers for a big retail company.</p>

<p>Even though we are passionate about our job and the Web Development in general, there is something in this specific mission that feels wrong for us.</p>

<p>We have been trying to find the main reason behind this negativity, and we may very well have found it : this is project driven by the technical choices.</p>

<p>It started out last year with a POC (spoiler alert, all POCs goes in production eventually), and since then the team only speaks about <em>microservices</em>, <em>Java</em>, <em>Spring</em>, <em>SpringBoot</em>, <em>Node.js</em>, <em>Puppeteer</em>, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>The results of it all being that we desperately try to make the <em>domain concerns</em> fit this technological knot bag.</p>

<h3>The search for a better world</h3>

<p>After speaking about this issue with our technical director and searching for resources on the Internet, we came across the <em>Domain Driven Design</em> principles and references.</p>

<p>I also have started to read more and more Clean Code and Architecture literature (mostly <em>Robert C. Martin</em>&rsquo;s and <em>Kent Beck</em>&rsquo;s books).</p>

<p>Though I have not finish reading the Blue Book yes (<em>Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</em> by <em>Eric Evans</em>), I am convinced that this is the right path to follow in order to solve our issues.</p>

<p>I already presented the concepts to the team, but I wanted to have a first experience with it before applying the principles in our application.</p>

<p>And so, here I am, <strong>building a blogging application</strong> in order to learn and try to apply these practices !</p>

<h2>Axes</h2>

<p>The main three axes for the project are the following :</p>

<ol>
<li>The domain</li>
<li>DevOps</li>
<li>Web Dev</li>
</ol>

<h3>The domain</h3>

<p>As explained before, my main frustration as a Web Developer is that we do not think about the domain as the most important concept.</p>

<p>We are not here to play with the technologies for the fun of it, but to create domain value.</p>

<p>My main focus during this project will be to apply the principles that I learn about DDD.</p>

<h3>DevOps</h3>

<p>I will admit it, I never have given myself the time to do more that scratching the surface about all of the DevOps area.</p>

<p>In this project, I really want to leave my comfort zone and take full advantage of this relatively new domain.</p>

<p>May it be the setup of a complete CI/CD pipeline, or the more advanced Docker possibilities.</p>

<p>I genuinely think that this is the most difficult part for a self learner with no previous experience in that field to get right.</p>

<p>There is a lot (and I mean <strong>a lot</strong>) of resources out there. But to be able to filter out the deprecated stuff and to find the most suitable solution is rather hard.</p>

<h3>Web Dev</h3>

<p>This axis is more &ldquo;for the fun&rdquo; than for the real value of it.</p>

<p>There are some subtopics about Web Development that I really want to dig into, such as <strong>the Server Side Rendering</strong> in Vue.js (pros and cons, how to set it up, &hellip;).</p>

<p>I also am interested in the making of a Web Application using only native Web Components.</p>

<p>This is the part that is likely to come last and least developed, as it is not the main point of the whole project.</p>

<h2>What is coming next</h2>

<p>I do not want to explain every details right now. Just know that I will post updates about the project as it goes.</p>

<p>I plain to log every interesting steps, may they be failures (via post-mortems) or successes.</p>

<p>It will be an honor and a pleasure to be able to start conversations and debates from those posts, so feel free to comment and share your opinion !</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, see you soon üòÅ</p>

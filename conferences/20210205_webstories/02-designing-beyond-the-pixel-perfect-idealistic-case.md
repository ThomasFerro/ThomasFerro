# Designing beyond the pixel-perfect idealistic case

> StÃ©phanie Walter (@WalterStephanie)

- Breach the gap between design and real world !
    - There are a lot of path next to the "happy path". How is it going to load, to manage error, globally or within components ?
    - Designing errors
        - Identify error cases with the dev team
        - Tell the user how to recover
        - Be consistent in language used
        - Don't blame the user
    - Empty state (no result, no more tasks, first use with empty state)
    - No content state
    - How does component scale up ? (pagination / lazy loading ?)
    - How does it works with other locales ?
    - Provide interaction states (hover / active / focus...)
    - Keyboard user ? Touch user ?
    - Design that scales
    - Build components that adapts to their containers instead of managing break points
        - => Container Query soon in CSS ? Flexbox can do the trick too
    - Embrace the fluid nature of the web, stop obsessing with pixel perfect
- ==> Challenge your assemptions

Great talk to share among all members of the development team!
